# React Starter (with Hooks)

A basic template that consists of the essential elements that are required to start building a React (v16.12+) application using Webpack (v4).

The template consists of:

* a typical project layout structure
* babel setup and configuration
* webpack setup and configuration
* eslint setup and configuration
* SCSS setup and configuration
* the main React component with hook to get started

Additionally, the template provides a development and production webpack configuration.

The template also allows one to include specific plugins as part of build. [Please see here for more detail](#build-application-with-bundleanalayzer-plugin-included)
